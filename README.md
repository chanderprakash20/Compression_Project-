🚀 Project Name: Compression_Project 

👋 Introduction: 
     Welcome to the Command-Line File Compression project! This is a simple yet efficient Rust-based tool that takes in a file          path,compresses it using gzip compression, and outputs it to another file. It is designed for fast, lightweight compression        and includes a progress bar to monitor the compression process.

This project showcases the use of Rust for file I/O operations, compression, and providing a clean user interface via the command line.

🛠 Features:


 File Compression: Compresses files using gzip compression for fast and efficient file storage.
 Progress Bar: A dynamic progress bar shows the status of the compression process.
Command-Line Interface (CLI): Accepts source and target file paths via the command line.
Cross-Platform: Works on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.
     

⚡ Tech Stack:
      Rust: A system programming language known for its performance and memory safety.
      Flate2: A Rust crate for gzip compression, enabling efficient file compression.
      Indicatif: Provides a progress bar for monitoring the file compression process in real-time.
      

🔧 Requirements:


To use this project, you need:
     Rust: Install it from rust-lang.org.
     Cargo: Cargo is the Rust package manager, and it comes with the Rust installation.
     
  💻 Installation:

  1. Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/yourusername/command-line-file-compression.git
   
  2.  cd https://github.com/chanderprakash20/Compression_Project-.git

  3. Build the project: cargo build --release
   
   
4. Run the program: make run
   
    🏃‍♂️ How It Works:
   
1. The program accepts two arguments: the source file (to be compressed) and the target file (for the compressed output).
   
   
2. It reads the source file, compresses it using gzip compression, and writes the compressed data to the target file.
   
   
3. A progress bar updates in real-time as the file is being compressed, allowing you to track its progress.
 
   🔥 Example Usage:
   
   Compress a text file:
   
   cargo run input.txt output.gz
   
Watch the progress bar update as the file is compressed!
